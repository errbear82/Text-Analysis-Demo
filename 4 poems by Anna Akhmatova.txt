He loved …
He loved three things in life:
Evensong, white peacocks
And old maps of America.
He hated it when children cried,
He hated tea with raspberry jam
And women’s hysterics.
…And I was his wife.
THE SONG OF THE LAST MEETING
Then helplessly my breast grew cold,
But my steps were light.
I pulled the glove for my left hand
Onto my right.
There seemed to be many steps,
But I knew – there were only three!
The whisper of autumn in the maples
Was pleading: “Die with me!
I am betrayed by my doleful,
Fickle, evil fate”
I answered: “Darling, darling!
I too. I will die with you …”
This is the song of the last meeting.
I glanced at the dark house.
Candles were burning only in the bedroom,
With an indifferent yellow flame.
And when in suicidal anguish
The nation awaited its German guests,
And the stern spirit of Byzantium
Had fled from the Russian Church;
When the capital by the Neva,
Forgetting her greatness,
Like a drunken prostitute
Did not know who would take her next,
A voice came to me. It called out comfortingly,
It said, “Come here,
Leave your sinful land,
Leave Russia forever.
I will wash the blood from your hands,
Root out the black shame from your heart,
With a new name I will conceal
The pain of defeats and injuries.”
But calmly and indifferently,
I covered my ears with my hands,
So that my sorrowing spirit
Would not be stained by those shameful words.
And confined to this savage capital,
We have forgotten forever
The lakes, the steppes, the towns,
And the dawns of our great native land.
Day and night in the bloody circle
A brutal languor overcomes us …
No one wants to help us
Because we stayed home,
Because, loving our city
And not winged freedom,
We preserved for ourselves
Its palaces, its fire and water.
A different time is drawing near,
The wind of death already chills the heart,
But the holy city of Peter
Will be our unintended monument.
