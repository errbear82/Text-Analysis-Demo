Scott Ritter, former UN Weapons Inspector WMD Whistleblower, sat down Sputnik discuss special operation. Sputnik: Speaking Maverick Multimedia 19 March,  Russia’s special operation Ukraine close being over Russia favour  Moscow military op will later studied specialists. What special about Russia operation,  opinion? Scott Ritter: I think thing separates Russian special operation Ukraine, apart other military operations  nature,  fact Russia does not intend occupy Ukraine.  something  Russian leadership very start. military operation  designed occupy  much more complicated operation requiring significantly more troops.  about holding cities, holding roads, holding specific geographical areas. Russian operation focused two non-geographical military focuses efforts. first denazification, elimination  right-wing neo-Nazi military formations  political parties support them, also demilitarization, elimination  NATO military infrastructure  installed Ukraine. kind focus allows Russia avoid trap being compelled carry out operations conquer territory, instead, focus  more specific task eliminating military formations  goal eventually leaving Ukraine. Azov battalion soldiers take oath Kiev before being sent Donbass Sputnik: Why  Western mainstream media continuing claim Russia Ukraine operation stalled? Does mean  do not understand Russia strategy objectives? does narrative serve some other purposes? Scott Ritter: I think there two reasons why West mischaracterising Russian military operation Ukraine. First  West evaluating  if were Russia intent occupy Ukraine.  very start, fact Russia coming  only 200,000 troops makes no military sense when  speaking  nation 40 million people  combined military capability around 600,000 troops. Normally want 3:1 advantage when offensive, Russia coming  1:3 military advantage.  people looking  map, looking  progress being made  Russian forces  characterize  being stalled because Russians aren't capturing Kiev, aren't capturing Kharkov, aren't conquering physical features  ground. not understanding  Russian objective isn't conquer territory  destroy military capability, which Russians doing quite well. other aspect  mischaracterisation  there an information warfare aspect  war.

Sputnik: Western pundits, politicians experts speculating about Russia possible chemical attack Ukraine.  not presented evidence Russia possesses such weapons, nor provided any proof such plans exist. What could  primary purpose  narrative? Scott Ritter: current narrative being put out Western leaders  Western media about Russians preparing chemical weapons attack Ukraine born  standard reaction when one side caught doing something shouldn't doing seek project blame onto other side. There no doubt  mind  Russians not preparing chemical weapons attack. makes no sense both military political standpoint. Plus, presumes existence  military-scale chemical warfare capability Russia Russia simply doesn't possess. what happened  Russia discovered biological research facilities inside Ukraine, operated  United States Department Defense, 've discovered certain research activities which difficult explain  United States could offensive biological warfare capacity.  United States embarrassed . what United States does , rather than address fact  an ongoing programme Ukraine  raised some questions, deflect, saying  reason why Russia bringing up  Russia preparing  biological weapons attack.

Sputnik: NATO  increasing military presence along eastern borders since beginning  Russian special operation Ukraine. What behind military build-up,  opinion? Scott Ritter: ongoing NATO build-up  eastern flank, I believe, an exercise confidence-building  part NATO.  talking about an organisation  just gone through,  past summer, terribly demoralising withdrawal Afghanistan. One made question relationship  premiere power NATO, United States. question ongoing viability NATO  military alliance. I mean what  purpose NATO? Russian incursion into Ukraine breathed new life into those who believe there an ongoing purpose NATO.  one thing say NATO relevant,  another thing make NATO relevant. one  things know about NATO  past decade  militarily impotent. doesn't viable military capacity. what going right now an effort NATO flex muscles convince itself ability stand up Russia. ,  mobilising these forces what I call feel good operation. forces insufficient meaningfully confront Russia,  sufficient look good paper make NATO feel good about itself. danger  if NATO flexing  mirror gets too impressed what  seeing believe  actual genuine military capacity, then seek use .

Sputnik: What  odds NATO troops getting involved  Ukraine conflict? Scott Ritter: If someone asked me  beginning  Russian incursion into Ukraine what  odds NATO getting involved? I would say zero because NATO made clear  not going get involved any fight between Ukraine Russia Ukrainian territory.  conflict goes , millions millions Ukrainians seek refuge NATO countries, now looking an economic humanitarian catastrophe NATO. there now people talking about not just imposing no-fly zone, actually putting NATO peacekeepers  ground western Ukraine. far, sanity prevailed  no-fly zone  rejected.

If happens, suddenly go zero chance  conflict between NATO Russia  100 percent chance  conflict between NATO Russia. Right now, I would say fifty-fifty.

NATO allies pinned Russia into position which  nowhere fall back , Putin stressed. According Dieterich, reasons forced Putin carry out special military operation Ukraine include: · NATO vow admit Ukraine  future; · Kiev military aggression against Donbass Lugansk after 2014 Euromaidan colour counter-revolution; · discrimination repression Russian-speakers Ukraine  systematic sabotage  Minsk Agreements Kiev; · growing weight neo-Nazi tendencies forces glorification WWII Nazi collaborators Ukraine; · intense deployment -NATO weapons trainers Ukraine.
