Sleep, my fine young baby
Lullabye, a-bye.
Quietly the clear moon looks down
Into your cradle
I will tell you stories,
I will sing you a song,
Sleep on, close your eyes,
Lullabye, a-bye.

The Terek runs over its rocky bed
And splashes its dark wave;
A sly brigand crawls along the bank
Sharpening his dagger;
But your father is an old warrior
Hardened in battle;
So sleep, my darling, undisturbed,
Lullaby a-bye.

The time will come, you will learn for yourself
The soldier's way of life,
Boldly you'll place your foot in the stirrup
And grasp your rifle.
Your fighting saddle I myself
Will embroider with silk
Sleep, my darling, my own one,
Lullaby a-bye.

Such a fine warrior you'll be to look at,
And a cossack in your soul.
I will watch you go, see you on your way,
And you'll wave your hand.
How many bitter tears silently
I will weep on that night when you go.
Sleep my angel, sweetly, softly,
Lullaby a-bye.
