Da-doo-da. Da-doo-da.

Wa, wa, wa, wa. Da-doo-da. Da-doo-da.



Summertime and the livin' is easy,
Fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high.
Oh your daddy's rich, and your ma is good lookin',
So hush, little baby, don' yo' cry.


One of these mornin's you goin' to rise up singin',
Then you'll spread yo' wings an' you'll take the sky.

 
But till that mornin', there's a-nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by.



Oh, nobody knows when the Lawd is goin' to call.


Roll dem bones, roll.


It may be in the summertime and maybe in the fall.


Roll dem bones, roll.


But you got to leave yo' baby and yo' home an' all,
So -

, 
Roll dem bones, oh, my brudder, oh my brudder,
Oh my brudder,
Roll dem bones, roll dem bones, roll, roll.



Seems like these bones don't give me
nothin' but boxcars tonight.
It was the same two weeks ago,
an' the game broke me;
I don't likes that kind o' luck!



Damn you, give me dem bones!


What do you say to these, Jake?


Them's the same cock-eyed bones
what clean the game out last Saturday night;
If they rolls in this game, I rolls out.


Honey boy!


Come on down, Robbins, we're waiting for you.


Honey, don't play tonight. Do like I say.


I been sweatin' all day.
Night time is man's time.
He got a right to forget his troubles.
He got a right to play.


If you hadn't been drinkin' you wouldn't
talk to me that way.
You ain't nebber hear Lord Jesus say
nuttin' 'bout got to play.


There you go again.
Lissen what I say.
I works all the week; Sunday got to pray.
But Saturday night a man's got a right to play.


A man's got a right to play.


Yes, sir, that's right. That ole lady of mine is hell on
savin' money to join the buryin' lodge.
I says spend it while you is still alive and kickin'.


Lord, I is tired this night.
I'm done with cotton.


Better come along with me on the Sea Gull.
I got room for another fisherman.


That suit me.
This cotton hook done swing its las' bale of cotton.
Here, who wants a cotton hook?


Summertime and the livin' is easy.
Fish are jumping etc.


Seven come, seven come to pappy!
Throw that beautiful number!
Come seven to me! Yeah, man!
I'll bet yo' wrong.

...Oh, yo' daddy's rich and yo' ma is good lookin'...


Come, seven! Shoot!

So hush, little baby, don't yo' cry!


Ol' man seven come down from heaven!


What, that chile ain't asleep yet? Give him to me.
I'll fix him for you.


Lissen to yo' daddy warn you,
'Fore you start a-travelling,
Woman may born you, love you and mourn you,
But a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.


Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.


Yo' mammy is the first to name you,
Then she'll tie you to her apron string,
Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you
Till yo' woman comes to claim you,
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.


Oh, a woman is a sometime thing.


Don't you never let a woman grieve you
Jus' cause she got yo' weddin' ring.
She'll love you and deceive you,
Take yo' clothes and leave you
'Cause a woman is a sometime thing.


Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing,
Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.

He got better sense than to listen to that nonsense.


Come back, Jake, you make a better crap shooter.

Yes man, I got honey in de comb.

Now we'll have a game!

I got a pocket full of the Buckra money,
and it's goin' to any man
what got the guts to shoot it off me.


Get on down, son we'll take it.


Lay it down.


All right, mens, roll 'em.
We done wait long enough.


You bes' wait for Crown. I see him comin',
takin' the whole sidewalk,
And he looks like he ain't gonna stand no foolin'.


Is Bess with him?


Lissen to Porgy.
I think he's sof' on Crown's Bess.


I ain't nebber swap two words with Bess.


Porgy got too good sense
to look twice at that liquor guzzlin' slut.


That gal Bess ain't fit for Gawd fearin'
ladies to 'sociate with.


Can't you keep yo' mouth off Bess.
Between Gawd fearin' ladies
and the Gawd damnin' men
that gal ain't got a chance.


Ain' I tells you Porgy sof' on her?


No, no, brudder, Porgy ain't sof' on no woman;
They pass by singin', they pass by cryin',
always lookin'.
They look in my do' an' they keep on movin'.
When Gawd make cripple,
He mean him to be lonely.
Night time, day time,
He got to trabble dat lonesome road.
Night time, day time,
He got to trabble dat lonesome road.



Here comes Big Boy!


'Low, Crown.


'Low, Bess.


Hi, boys! All right, Sporting Life,
give us a pint and make it damn quick.

Pay him, Bess.



Drunk again!


He sure love his liquor, but some day
she's gonna throw him down.


That damn whiskey'-jus' as weak as water.



See that hussy drinkin' like any man!


Here, Robbins,
have one to the Gawd fearin' ladies.
There's nothin' like 'em, thank Gawd.


Oh, no, you don't.
Nobody ain't drinkin' none of my licker.

All right, mens, I'm talkin' to you.
Anybody answerin' me?


Boxcars again.


Cover 'em, brother, cover 'em.


Cover hell! I goin' to pass 'em along
and see if I can break my luck.


Robbins' lady ain't allow him but
fifty cent and he can't take
no chances with bad luck.


That's all right, honey boy,
I'll stake you when yo' four bits done gone.


Go ahead an' play.
You don't need no charity off no she-devils.


See what I gets for you.
Yo' woman is easy when you know the way.


Crapped out!


Don't you ever let a woman grieve you.

, 
She'll love you and deceive you,
take yo' clothes and leave you
'Cause--


A woman is a sometime thing.


Yes, a woman is a sometime thing.


That gal ain't need to worry 'bout
no man marryin' her.


Some women got to marry a man to keep him.


Shut yo' damn mouth!
You don't give Mingo a chance to talk to the bones.


Fade me.

Old snake-eye go off an' die.
Old man seven come down from heaven.

Seven!


I ain't seen that seven yet.
You done turn 'em over.

That is the trouble. Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha!
Licker ain't strong enough.
Give me a pinch of happy dust, Sportin' Life.



Don't give him that stuff, Sportin' Life.
He's ugly drunk already.


Pay him an' shut up.



Frien' an' dice an' happy dust

You mens bes' go slow.

He ain't mean no harm.


Huh, seven! Huh, seven! Huh, seven!

Oh, stop them! Don't let them fight!
I warned him, oh! Won't somebody stop them,
Won't somebody stop them now!

You're his widow?


Yes, suh.


He did not leave any burial insurance?


No, boss, he didn't leave nuttin'.


Well, see to it he's buried tomorrow.

You killed Robbins an' I'm going to hang you for it!


He ain't don um!


What he say?


He say you kill Robbins.


Come along now!


'Fore Gawd, boss, I ain't never done um!


Who did it, then?
You heard me, who did it?


Crown done it, boss. I done see him do it.


You're sure you saw him?


I swear to Gawd, boss,
I was right there beside him.


That's easy. I thought as much.

You. You saw it too.
I don't want to have to put the law on you.
Look at me, you damn dummy!


I don't know nuttin' 'bout it, boss.


That's your room in the corner, ain't it?


Yes, boss, dat's my room.


The door opens on the court, don't it?


Yes, boss, my door opens on the court.


An' yet you didn't see or hear anything?


I don't know nuttin' 'bout it, boss. I been asleep inside,
and my door been closed.


You're a damn liar.

He saw the killing;
take him along and lock him up as a material witness.


Come along, uncle.


I ain't done it, boss.


How long you goin' lock him up for?


Till we catch Crown.


I reckon Crown done loose now in de palmetto thickets,
an' dere ain' no rope long enough to hang him.


Then the old man's out of luck.
Remember, you've got to bury that body tomorrow
or the board of health will take him an' turn him
over to the medical students.
Come on, get the old man in the wagon.


I ain't never done nuttin', boss.

I swear to Gawd I ain' never done nuttin'.


I can't puzzle this thing out. Peter was a good man,
but dat lousy Crown was a killer
and forever gettin' into trouble.


That's the truth, brother.


And there go Peter to be lock up like a thief.


Like a thief.


An' here be Robbins with his wife
and his fadderless chillen,
an' Crown done gone his ways drinkin',
gamblin', swearin',
to do the same thing over and over somewheres else.


Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.


My man's gone now,
Ain't no use alistenin'
For his tired foot-steps
Climbin' up de stairs. Ah!
Ole Man Sorrow
Come to keep me comp'ny,
Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers. Ah-
Ain't dat I min' workin'·
Work an' me is travellers
Journeyin' togedder
To de promise land.
But Ole Man Sorrow's
Marchin' all de way wid me
Tellin' me I'm ole now
Since I lose my man.


Since she lose her man.


Since I lose my man.


Ah!


Ole Man Sorrow sittin' by de fireplace,
lyin' all night long by me in de bed.
Tellin' me de same thing mornin', noon an' eb'nin'.
That I'm all alone now since my man is dead.
Ah! Since my man is dead!


Ah!


Ah!


How de saucer stan' now, my sister?


There ain't but fifteen dollar.


Hum! Can't bury him for fifteen dollar.


He got to be buried tomorrow or the board of health
will take him and give him to the medical students.


Life is hard, brudder, but we all got to live.
It cos' money for to bury a grown man.


Oh, for Gawd sake,

Don't let the students take him
to cut up an' scatter.

I goin' pay you ev'ry cent.


All right, sister,
