Yes, I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got no car, got no mule
I got no misery
Folks with plenty of nothing
They've got a lock on the door
Afraid somebody's going to rob 'em
While they is out making more
What for?
I got no lock on the door, that's no way to be
They can steal the rug from the floor, that's OK with me
'Cause the things that I prize like the stars in the skies are all free
I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got my girl, got my song
Got heaven the whole day long
Got my girl, got my love, yes got my song
Oh, I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got the sun, got the moon
Got the deep blue sea
The folks with plenty of plenty
Got to pray all the day
Seems with plenty you sure got to worry
How to keep the devil away, away
I ain't frettin 'bout hell
'Til the time arrive
Never worry long as I'm well
Never one to strive
To be good, to be bad
What the hell
I am glad I'm alive
Oh, I got plenty of nothing
And nothing's plenty for me
I got my man, got my song
Got heaven the whole day long
Got my man, got my love, yes got my song
Got plenty, got plenty
Got plenty of nothing
Got plenty of nothing
