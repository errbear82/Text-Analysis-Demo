Summertime,
And the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin'
And the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich
And your mum is good lookin'
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
One of this mornings
You're going to rise up singin'
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But till that morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mummy standin' by
One of this mornings
You're going to rise up singin'
Then you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But till tha morning
There's a'nothing can harm you
With daddy and mummy standin' by
