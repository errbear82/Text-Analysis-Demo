 @Telegraph : 🔴 Frustrated army chiefs are urging the Russian president to drop the term “special operation” used for the invasion and instead declare war.

Such a declaration would enable mass mobilisation of Russians

 @independentob10 : @sentdefender In other words, he has run out of bodies to throw into the buzzsaw using the false special military operation.

He is still trying to create his czarist fever dreams.
Before Russia goes special military operation, US pres “predicted”(luring) Russia will attack Ukraine by its MASTER PLAN. Haha!
 @sowegaCat : The thing is, it’s in the country’s best interest not to let Putin spread disinformation about the war. But they call it censorship. Of course they also call us groomers and the war a special military operation 🙄
 @Angry_Staffer : @Oriana0214 We’ve already seen a significant escalation of aid during “phase 2” of Putin’s “special military operation,” (howitzers, LCMRs, etc.) and I think that’s likely to continue. 

Biden’s requested 33 billion is HUGE. 

Rumor has it we are also training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s. 😳

Putin is desperately looking for an excuse for full mobilization. So he may abandon the term special operation and declare an all-out war on May 9. But it would be fairy dangerous for Russia b/c it has to be operated with a weakened economy under the sanctions by the West.

 @les_politiques : #Putin’s decision also included limits on the war, which Moscow calls a ‘special military operation.’ This... is paicularly intriguing... The Russian army has refrained from shelling anywhere near central Kiev. Unlike #US war in Iraq, Putin’s war is not war, no less total war

@aaronjmate and @kthalps Watched your interview with Michael Hudson today. I wondered why you didn't ask a follow up question when he stated that he thought the Russian special operation in Ukraine would take 30 years to finish. Would have liked to know his reasoning for that.
 @CanadianUkrain1 : GM. Story time. 

It was April. #Russian aillerymen came to the #Ukrainian steppes on a special operation, with malice in their little heas. 

One early morning, however, their trip was abruptly cut sho when they neglected to secure their rear.

Special military operation in Ukraine. 10 Busted myths.

1. The tank on the battlefield is outdated.
2. Tanks cannot be effectively used in urban areas.
3. Bayraktar is an invincible weapon.
4. The future belongs to compact professional armies.

 @Angry_Staffer : @Oriana0214 We’ve already seen a significant escalation of aid during “phase 2” of Putin’s “special military operation,” (howitzers, LCMRs, etc.) and I think that’s likely to continue. 

Biden’s requested 33 billion is HUGE. 

Rumor has it we are also training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s. 😳

@POTUS Your recalcitrance will only ensure the total destruction of #Ukraine. People who really care about Ukraine would have advised Ukraine to declare neutral status towards #NATO and #Russia in December. Then there would have been no need for this Special Military Operation by Russia

@francis_scarr This is so interesting when you think about it ... calling it a special military operation implies that Russian initiated it (for a limited purpose) ... but if they change it to a war, doesn't that concede that Russia staed the war?

_ 12% of its soldiers (total includes trained draftees)
_ 10% of its fighter jets
_ 7% of its tanks
_ 5% of its missiles
_ 4% of its aillery
And keeps advancing on a daily basis.
Someone please correct me if I’m wrong. The only people saying the special military operation is meant to be complete by May 9th is western media, Russia as far as I’m aware haven’t suggested having a deadline in date.

My opinion on Russia shifted after hearing @KofmanMichael’s latest podcast. As long as Putin keeps calling it a special operation, he can spin any outcome into a win.

This means they don’t need to go nuclear, figuratively or literally.

Putin is going to try claim a small victory in Ukraine for May 9th. I would not be surprised if Mariupol is that small victory. Remember, Russia's main justification for its special operation in Ukraine is to defeat Nazism. Mariupol is perceived as hea of Azov.
