Earlier, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) said the Ukrainian military had installed about 420 mines at the entrance to the ports of Odessa, Ochakov, Chornomorsk and Yuzhnoe since the beginning of the Russian military operation in the country. Kiev is barring foreign ships blocked in Ukrainian ports from leaving, threatening to immediately sink them, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. Volodymyr Zelensky's claims that Russia has blocked about 100 foreign ships in Ukrainian ports is a lie, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said, adding that the Kiev authorities have forcibly detained 68 ships from different countries in the ports of four cities. Every day, Russia opens a safe corridor for the exit of these vessels from the territorial waters of Ukraine to the south-west, but their crews told Russian military that the ships are banned from leaving the Ukrainian ports under the threat of immediate sinking, the Konashenkov added. The Ukrainian Navy placed 420 anchor mines in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea from 25 February to 4 March, Igor Konashenkov said, denying claims by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Russia was allegedly mining the Black Sea. As a result of a storm in the Black Sea and due to unsatisfactory technical condition, cables with bottom anchors broke at about 10 Ukrainian mines. Since then, under the influence of wind and surface currents, Ukrainian mines have been drifting freely in the western part of the Black Sea in the southerly direction, Konashenkov said, noting that no one can know where the remaining Ukrainian mines are drifting today. On 24 February, Russia launched a special military operation in Ukraine after the breakaway republics of Donetsk and Lugansk appealed for help in defending themselves against Ukrainian provocations. In response to Russiaâ€™s operation, Western countries have rolled out a comprehensive sanctions campaign against Moscow.
