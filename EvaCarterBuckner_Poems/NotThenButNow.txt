 Thy Place unfilled;
 Not when we need thy voice, thy pen,
 Forever stilled;
 Not when we fain would call thee back
 And smooth thy brow;
 Not when, alas! It is too late.
 Not then, but now.

Now, while thy people s cause you plead,
 Enlisting friends;
 Now, while wrong seems to yet prevail
 Thy work extends;
 Now, while the call throughout the land
 Is for the true;
 Now, at this crisis, noble one,
 We ve need of you.

Now, while you plead the world to take
 A broader view.
 Now when you say to men, Be men
 And dare to do ;
 Now, know it now! We know they worth,
 Our cheer allow; Now, ere too late we prize thee, friend,
 Not then, but Now
