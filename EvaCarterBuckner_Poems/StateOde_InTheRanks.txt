Our colored women true Of California too Are in the Ranks; We'll sing it loud and clear He'll guide and he will cheer Us as we go.

Our boys and girls must stand As giants in the land With torches high Come rouse from the slugged sleep And help the vigil keep What tho' the clouds hang low There's blue beyond.

Behold the morning ray Turns darkness into day As we go on. We'll guard Old Glory too, To her we'll ever be true; We'll ever dare and do With God our Guide.
