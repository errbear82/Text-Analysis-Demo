But yester' came a song so bright
 From Tulsa's children of the night;
 A song of joy, love and cheer,
 Of happy hearts with naught to fear.
Today a homeless hapless throng
 Sing to the world a sorrow song;
 Old Prejudice the snake, the fiend,
 The harvest watched then stealthily gleaned.
Bereft of those they loved so well
 The suff'ring ones the story tell;
 But He who marks the sparrow's fall
 Is still the ruler over all.
May she who kept her Holy Book
 Though on its pages could not look,
 Still trust in God to give her peace
 In Him alone she'll find surcease.
'Twas mother instinct in the child
 That to her doll clung, though the wild
 Flames leaped and flared with angry tongue
 And mothers to their children clung.
Where could they look? Where could they go?
 They could not tell the friend from foe.
 Oh whom or what does rest the blame
 That puts our Christian land to shame?
Is Cain a-stalking through the land,
 And leading on a mur'drous band?
 Our glorious flag do we forget?
 And our allegiance now regret?
Tomorrow must our land be ruled
 By this young blood that's being schooled
 In prejudice and crime so bold?
 If so, what does the future hold?
What right has Prejudice to kill,
 To torture, and our country fill
 With criminals, and precept to prate
 Before the youth to imitate
The stoic heart may laugh and tell
 Of these portentious deeds we'd quell;
 But Oh! remember Belgium's fate,
 May we fore see before too late.
Oh, Nation grand arouse, awake!
 A firmer stand for justice take;
 The laws of our dear land uphold
 and stop these heinous crimes so bold.
A song is sung of wrong and might
 By Tulsa's children of the night;
 It is a sad a sorrow song
 In pleading voice--"Oh Lord, how long?"
