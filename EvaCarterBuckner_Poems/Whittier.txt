In fancy we saw thee taking thy flight.

To that beautiful city so fair, Oh tell us on whom did thy mantle fall.

Or does it still hang in mid-air? Or did you keep the gift from above. To write of the beauties untold. And to help weave the songs that the angels sing As they play on their ha rps of gold?

We boast of the freedom thou so longed to see, And each generation sings praise: And while the vast number thy name celebrate

We, too, our voices shall raise. Oh long may our country do honor to men

Whose stand for the right will not sway, And now with the nation we breathe a prayer. "God bless thy natal day."
