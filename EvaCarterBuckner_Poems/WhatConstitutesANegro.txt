When the first slave-ship was landed
with its cargo on this side,
There was then no vexing question
As to which race he's allied;
Just a Negro, pure and simple,
And as such might have remained,
But--well, here we drop the subject,
For there is nothing to be gained.
Years have passed, and now we see him
On him's turned the strongest light;
Every race is represented——
Black, brown, yellow, red and white;
And they call him now a problem,
For there's One not been consulted
And in it He is involved.
There's rise and fall of Nations,
But, dispute it if you can,
There is just one God and Father
And the brotherhood of man.
Ten-tenths blood of pure Caucasian
This it takes to make you white.
But one drop of Negro blood is
Just the same, as black as night
For this stamp was put upon him
And so let it thus remain,
For what is the use contending
All contentions are in vain.

It is said ten million Negroes
On this firm free land doth stand.
God inspires him to mount upward
Though chains bind both foot and hand.
Read his crimes in boldest letters,
Negro and no question then;
And we own him, our heads bowing,
Grieved to know we have such men.
On the other hand turning.
We can point with pride to those
Who thought it worth while in striving,
And to fame and honor rose.
Dumas, known as the French nov'list,
He his Negro blood could trace;
Tanner, artist known so widely,
Who has won himself a place.
Yes, and there is the "Black Napoleon,"
Brace "Toussaint L'Ouverture,"
And the great Edmonia Lewis,
Sculptress, whose work will endure.

And we claim S. Coleridge Taylor;
Dunbar, though he's dead still lives;
Booker Washington we all know,
For the race his best thoughts gives;
Bishop Grant, in sermons, lectures;
Dubois, Jhon H. Jackson, true;
Chestnut, Vernon, trace 'em; Pushkin,
Browning, many others, too.
Great Rome had her gladiators,
And of them was very proud;
We care nothing for the prize-ring
But,since it has been allowed,
Why not then applaud the winner,
Whether white or dusky man
The survival of the fittest
Is the rule and it will stand.

Call him Ishmaelite or Arab,
Paraphrase him, if you will;
Say Egyptian, if more pleasing,
But he is a Negro still.
This would be a grander Nation
With the goodness that's innate.
It would be a perfect haven——
But the prejudice——too great.
But, there friends,
Join us in life's great combat,
Though your skin be dark, what matter!
You're a man, e'en for all that;
And we are using every effort
To make good whare e'er we trod,
One hand with the flag a waving,
And the other stretched to God.
