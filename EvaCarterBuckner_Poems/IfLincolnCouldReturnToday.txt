If Lincoln could return today,
 I wonder what he'd think and say
 About this great and glorious land
 O'er which he once had full command?
 With all the progress he would see
 I know he would astonished be
I The lightning speed of which we boast
 A touch, a sound from coast to coast,
 The clearly distance-spoken words,?
 Ships sailing through the air like birds,
 Num'rous inventions small and great
 Too many to enumerate.
With all these things so strange and new,
 I'm sure he'd scarce know what to do,
 And like a wanderer on the strand-
 A stranger in his own home land,
 Until he'd look around and see
 That same old Flag of Liberty.
I wonder then if he'd recall
 The greatest deed he did for all?
 And that if he would sorry be
 That he had set the captive free?
 What set the million captives free?
 Oh yes, the world knows it was he.
But 'twas a mightier hand you see
 Guided the pen, 'twas so to be,
 That all His legacy might share
 What you and I love best--free air;
 And too, his knowing eye could, see
 That to advance, all must be free.
And Nature says and it is true
 To crush the one, we crush the two;
 And all who love their country true
 Love Lincoln's name, naught else to do.
 But Oh! could he return today-
 I wonder what he'd think and say?
"Oh! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
 O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
