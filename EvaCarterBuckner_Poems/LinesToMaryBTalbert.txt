"And so will I go--and if 1 perish I perish,"--Eather 4:16

Ah! we love you, noble sister,
 And it's yours to dare and do;
 For we need you, and you need us,
 And we'll ever stand by you.
Go and meet the foreign sisters,
 Represent your women true,
 Ah, to venture at this moment
 Is a noble thing to do.
But "the hand that rocks the cradle
 Is the hand that rules the world;"
 By the sons that she hath given
 Doth the flag remain unfurled.
Naught but victory awaits you
 Through the rough ways you may trod,
 But His sweet voice whispering says, "Be
 Still, and know that 1 am God."
And we're hoping, praying, cheering,
 Though for you our hearts will yearn,
 May God speed you, may He bless you,
 We'll be waiting your return.
