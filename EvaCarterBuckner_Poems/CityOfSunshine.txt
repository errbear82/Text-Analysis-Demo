City of Sunshine home so dear,
 Where the skies are ever clear,
 Where the purest waters flow,
 And the mountain breezes blow;
 With the grand old peak in view,
 And the scen'ry ever new,
 Though from thee I far may roam,
 Thou art still my cherished home.

Chorus:

Oh! Why did I roam
 From my dear mountain home?
 The breeze seems to be
 Whispering to me,
 City of Sunshine, I speed thee a line,
 No longer I yearn, I gladly return,
 Gladly, gladly, I return.

At morning s early hour.
 While the dew's yet on the flower,
 And when evening shadows fall,
 Sweetest mem'ries I recall;
 There are other places fair to see;
 But there are none so dear to me;
 And my heart it breathes a sigh,
 Fain, ah! Fain to thee I d fly.
