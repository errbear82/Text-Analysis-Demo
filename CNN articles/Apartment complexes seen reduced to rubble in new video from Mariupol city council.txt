A downed power line tower, burned-out cars and apartment complexes gutted by military strikes can be seen in new video from Mariupol, which was posted by the Ukrainian city's council on Thursday.

CNN has geolocated and verified the authenticity of the video.

The video starts with a car driving south down Krupina Street. This area of western Mariupol has seen intense fighting for weeks, and nearly every single building — including a number of hospitals — in the area has sustained significant damage.

This is how some roads in general look like, someone in the car is heard saying in the video as it drives through two arms of a toppled-over power line transmission tower. We have to pass through using such a miraculous method. The trees around them are charred, with most of their branches seen splintered around them on the ground.

The apartment complexes on the left are also charred. On a side road between two of the apartment buildings, the bombed-out remains of a city bus and bulldozer are seen.

A clear blue sky is seen through the apartment building-turned-debris pile, with only portions of the facades and balconies still standing in parts of the building.

Further down the street, the remains of a local gym is seen.
